Bulgogi Pizza – Korea 

After the Korean War, pizza was introduced to South Korea. In places where the U.S. Army was stationed, pizza shops started popping up. Korean pizza is the Korean adaptation of the American pizza: big, circular, and fatty. This is very different from the Italian thin-crust pizza of the world. 

Recipe:

Ingredients:
-premade pizza dough
Sauce 
-½ tablespoon brown sugar
-1 tablespoon soy sauce
-½ tablespoon rice wine
-¼ teaspoon oyster sauce
-1/8 teaspoon minced garlic
-1/8 teaspoon sesame oil
Thickening Agents (mix in bowl together)
-1 teaspoon potato or corn starch 
-1 tablespoon water
Toppings
-1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
-1 small mushroom, thinly sliced
-20 grams sliced black olives
-20 grams brown onion, thinly sliced
-100 grams bulgogi (marinated Korean BBQ beef), cooked and cut into smaller pieces if desired
-1 tablespoon corn kernels, drained 
-30 grams green bell pepper, finely diced

Directions: 
1.        Preheat oven to 390˚F (200˚C). Place pizza stone in oven if using it while oven preheats.
2.        Make the Bulgogi sauce in a pan. Add all the sauce ingredients into the pan and bring to a boil. Boil over low heat for about 10 to 20 seconds. Add the thickening agent and stir well until the sauce is thickened. Scoop out into a bowl and set aside. 
3.        Assemble the pizza. Roll out the pre-made pizza dough. Pour the sauce over the dough and spread thinly. Sprinkle the shredded cheese. Add the mushrooms, olives, onion, and Bulgogi on top. Scatter the corn kernels and bell peppers between the gaps. 
4.        Transfer the pizza on the pizza stone or floured baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
5.        Take the pizza out of the oven, slice, and enjoy.

Deep Dish – Chicago, USA

In 1943, Italian entrepreneurs in Chicago wanted to create a new style of pizza that hadn’t been done before. They opened a restaurant named Pizzeria Uno and sold a “deep dish” pizza. A pizza with a deeper dish, inverted layers, and a much crunchier crust. 

Recipe:

Ingredients:
-1 teaspoon dried yeast
-¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
-1 teaspoon caster sugar
-250g of baker’s flour
-¼ cup (60ml) of olive oil, plus extra to drizzle
-1 small eggplant, cut into 2cm pieces
-1 red capsicum, cut into 2cm pieces
-1 zucchini, cut into 2cm pieces
-1 ¼ cups (125g) grated mozzarella cheese
-⅓ cup (25g) grated pecorino 
-1 garlic clove, halved
-400ml good-quality pizza sauce
-basil leaves, to serve

Directions:
1.	Combine yeast, cream of tartar, sugar, and 150ml of warm water into a bowl. Set this aside for 10 minutes or until the mixture starts to froth. 
2.	Place flour in a bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the yeast mixture and oil, then bring the dough together with your hands. Transfer to a floured surface and knead for 5-6 minutes until smooth and elastic. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot for an hour or until doubled in size. 
3.	Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking tray with baking paper. Place the eggplant, capsicum, and zucchini on the tray, drizzle with extra olive oil and seasoning. Roast for 15 minutes or until tender. Set aside. Increase oven temperature to 400˚F (200˚C).
4.	Combine the mozzarella and pecorino in a bowl.
5.	Brush a 22cm or 24cm cast-iron pan with extra oil, then rub all over the cut side of the garlic. Knock down dough, then, using your hands, stretch the dough until it is large enough to line the pan halfway up the side (or roll out with a rolling pin). Scatter over half the cheese mixture, then the roasted vegetables, then the pizza sauce. Top with the remaining cheese mixture.
6.	Bake for 25 minutes or until the dough is puffed and golden around the edges, and the cheese is bubbling. Rest for 5 minutes before serving topped with basil.
